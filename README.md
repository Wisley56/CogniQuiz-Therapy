## Introduction

CogniQuiz Therapy is a mobile quiz application developed in Kotlin, aiming to help users reflect on their thoughts and alleviate negativity, following the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This app was designed as a simple tool to assist in practicing CBT techniques interactively and accessibly.

## Features

The app comprises the following screens:

1. **User Identification Screen:** Allows users to input basic information to personalize the quiz experience.
2. **App Introduction:** Provides a brief overview of the app's purpose and functionality.
3. **Quiz Screen:** Presents a series of CBT-related questions for users to answer.
4. **Feedback Screen:** Displays feedback based on the user's performance in the quiz, offering insights and suggestions for reflection.

## Technologies Used

The app was developed in Kotlin, utilizing XML for the view system, with the potential for migration to Jetpack Compose in the future. Aiming to implement an architecture pattern to enhance code organization and scalability represents one of the developer's areas of improvement in this project.

## Origin of the Idea

The project originated from a collaboration between the developer and a friend about to graduate in psychology. The friend planned to develop a game for a college assignment, which inspired the developer to suggest the idea of ​​creating an app focused on CBT, not only to assist her in the academic work but also as an opportunity to practice and enhance their Android development skills.

## Current State and Future

CogniQuiz Therapy is continually evolving, with this being the first version of the application. The developer intends to continue improving the app by adding new features, refining the user experience, and exploring new technologies and development approaches. This initial version represents just the beginning of a project aimed at offering an increasingly comprehensive and effective tool to assist in CBT practice.
